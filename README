adv7180 driver for iMX6
=======================

This is a enhancement of the tca8418 driver found in the Freescale/NXP 3.14 
kernel.  

The tca8148 is primarily used for interfacing keypads, and the existing driver
supported this well, but the device also can be used for gpio (often for 
driving leds).

This extended driver exposes the device as a gpio controller.  Care must be
taken to not reuse pins used for keyscanning as gpio, i.e. look at the 
keypad,num-rows and keypad,num-columns parameters and only use row or
column pins higher than these.

See tca8418_keypad.txt for device tree bindings, and more information.
